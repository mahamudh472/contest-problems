- I love solving problems. My journey with programming is started from a programming contest I was participated in my high school. Because of my finencial condition I can't spend
  time with problem solving, I have to focus on web development so that I can earn. For this reason I am not actively solving problems but for the love I have with problem solving
  I make some times in a week and solve some problems in sites like codeforces or leetcode. This repsitory is to store the solutions.

> It's not like I will reuse these codes, but these makes me feel my progress....
